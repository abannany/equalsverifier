Have you ever written an `equals` method, along with five screens of unit tests to test it? Or worse: not bothered to test it at all, because "the IDE generates it anyway"?

EqualsVerifier helps you. Testing `equals` can be as simple as:

{% highlight java %}
@Test
public void equalsContract() {
    EqualsVerifier.forClass(Foo.class).verify();
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you feel EqualsVerifier is too strict, you can make it more lenient:

{% highlight java %}
@Test
public void simpleEqualsContract() {
    EqualsVerifier.simple().forClass(Foo.class).verify();
}
{% endhighlight %}

And EqualsVerifier even gives you 100% coverage on `equals` and `hashCode` methods.


Sounds great, how do I use it?

Add it to your build like this (please adjust for your build system of choice):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>nl.jqno.equalsverifier</groupId>
    <artifactId>equalsverifier</artifactId>
    <version>3.4.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}
